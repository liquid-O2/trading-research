  title: Atlas Public API
  version: 1.0.0
  summary: OHLCV price history as a TradingView-UDF datafeed.
  description: >
    Atlas exposes Skylit's real-time and historical **OHLCV** (open / high / low

    / close / volume) price bars as a versioned public HTTP API that implements

    the TradingView **UDF** (Universal Data Feed) datafeed contract. Point a

    TradingView Charting Library datafeed at `https://atlas-api.skylit.ai/v1`,
    or

    call the endpoints directly.


    **Authentication.** Send your Skylit API key as a bearer token:

        Authorization: Bearer <key>

    (`X-API-Key: <key>` is also accepted.) One Skylit key spans every product —

    the same key and credit balance work for Heatseeker and Flowseeker.


    **Credit metering.** Each chargeable request debits a fixed cost from your

    balance:


    | Endpoint       | Cost |

    |----------------|-----:|

    | `/v1/history`  | 1    |

    | `/v1/search`   | 1    |

    | `/v1/symbols`  | 1    |

    | `/v1/config`   | 0    |

    | `/v1/time`     | 0    |


    New customers are seeded with 5,000 credits. Every chargeable response

    carries `X-Credits-Remaining: <balance>`. Out of credits → `402`

    `insufficient_credits`; an admin-suspended account → `403`

    `account_suspended`. `/v1/config` and `/v1/time` are free metadata calls.


    Note that a charting client fetches `/v1/history` in **pages** (it walks the

    `to` cursor backward to fill the requested range), so a deep history pull

    naturally costs one credit per page — the cost scales with the data you

    actually retrieve.


    **Request-window limit.** One `/v1/history` call may span at most a fixed

    number of **trading days**, set by the bar tier the resolution reads from —

    not by the resolution itself. `240` and `60` share the 1-hour tier and

    therefore share its allowance.


    | Tier   | Resolutions                | Max trading days / request |

    |--------|----------------------------|---------------------------:|

    | 1-min  | `1` `2` `3` `5` `15` `30`  |                         90 |

    | 1-hour | `60` `240` `480`           |                        720 |

    | 1-day  | `D` `W`                    |                      2,600 |


    A window **wider than the cap is rejected with `400`**, carrying the two

    numbers a client needs to react (`requested_days`, `max_days`). It is never

    silently shortened — a short `{ "s": "ok" }` always means the data ends

    there, never that your range was clipped. Page through anything wider in

    windows of `max_days` or fewer.


    A rejected `400` still debits 1 credit, because metering happens before the

    request is inspected. The caps are fixed and published above, so check your

    range before sending it rather than discovering the limit by retrying — a

    client that retries a `400` unchanged burns credits without ever

    succeeding.


    **Rate limits.** A safety ceiling of 600 requests / minute is enforced by

    the Skylit gateway and surfaced via `X-RateLimit-Limit`,

    `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`. `429` includes

    `Retry-After`. This is runaway protection, not a quota — credit metering

    does the per-customer accounting.


    **The datafeed flow.** A UDF client calls `/v1/config` once for the feed's

    capabilities, `/v1/symbols` to resolve a ticker (price scale, session,

    supported resolutions), then `/v1/history` for the bars; `/v1/search` powers

    the symbol picker and `/v1/time` the server clock. History follows the UDF

    convention: a `200` with `{ "s": "ok", ... }` on success and `{ "s":

    "no_data" }` when the window has no bars (not a `404`); an over-wide range

    is a `400` with `{ "s": "error", "errmsg": ... }` plus `requested_days` and

    `max_days`. Auth and credit errors, which aren't part of UDF, use the

    envelope `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`.
