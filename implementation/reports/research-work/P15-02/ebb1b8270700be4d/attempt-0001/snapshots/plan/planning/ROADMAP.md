# Research program roadmap

Status: implementation specifications, version `research-plan-2026-09-14-v2`. Phase 1 is complete for the acquired observed-input population. The original Phase 1.5 foundation implementation failed independent acceptance review; the remaining subphases and Phase 2 are specified.

The [v2 assurance amendment](/workspace/planning/research-program/ASSURANCE.md) applies to all 46 tasks and all 17 subphases. Until replacement foundation receipts and their matching review pass, use the [foundation repair prompt](/workspace/planning/research-program/FOUNDATION_REPAIR.md#copyable-repair-prompt), before `01-native-and-outcomes`. [Current execution status](/workspace/wiki/current-status.md) links the applicable evidence; an old completion message cannot authorize the next subphase.

The objective is an adaptive NQ decision process whose context, location and response components can each be tested. Source methods supply baselines and mechanisms; they do not impose a fixed model count. All numerical choices introduced in these packs are our registered research policies, not recovered proprietary constants.

| Development phase | Responsibility and deliverable | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — complete | Reconstruct and measure source-linked setups. [Evidence](/workspace/planning/phase-1-live/PHASE.md). | Accepted acquired census; limitations carried forward. |
| 1.5 — specified | Reconstruct missing numerical rules; improve CVD; compare representative formation, reference, sequence, confirmation and setup rules; refine within a finite budget; retain unchanged-entry exit comparisons. [Pack](/workspace/planning/phase-1-5/README.md). | Every task has a verified terminal disposition, all attempted variants are recorded, baseline and selected rules are frozen. No winner is required. |
| 2 — specified | Intraday jointly fitted volatility/range forecasts, native options context and intraday OI/IV updates, auction/session/cross-market forecasts, and separately fitted method context experts. [Pack](/workspace/planning/phase-2/README.md). | Chronological predictions, conditional plans, input lineage, ablations, calibration and support limits are reproducible. |
| 3 — scope reserved | Fitted location experts: P-zone upgrades, forward-volatility-derived actionable areas, native gamma/vega/vanna/OI/volume/VWAP/prior-extreme areas, arrival and conditional reaction, competing areas. | Detailed implementation pack follows the actual Phase 2 outputs. |
| 4 — scope reserved | Response/entry experts and integrator: combine context and location, choose whether/when to enter NQ, use cross-asset responses, evaluate account-level execution and risk. | Combined historical replay and daily economic distribution; prospective evidence remains separate. |
| Later management work — recommendation | Empirical exit/management specialists, thesis changes and re-entry after fixed-entry controls. | Not a user-approved numbered Phase 5; do not silently add partial contracts to a one-mini account. |

**All of Phase 1.5 must finish before Phase 2 implementation.** The packs may be read now; their runners may not cross this gate. Independent tasks within a released subphase can run concurrently with one owner per output path.

## Decisions that implementation must preserve

- NQ is the execution asset. Study 2020 onward on owned data, using earlier data only for causal lookbacks. Include every matching session within an account day; source branches retain their particular clocks. No position crosses the account-day boundary.
- Other assets do not run Jumbo, Green Bird or Sires clones. Their custom locations are gamma, vega, vanna, OI, rolling-volume improvements, VWAP/bands and prior highs/lows. Flow and response may come from another asset. A location on A, response on B and execution on NQ is allowed without an NQ local touch for a separately named custom candidate. Source-linked NQ methods keep their required NQ stages.
- Cover native NDX/NDXP, SPX/SPXW, QQQ, SPY, NQ, ES and their owned option chains. Verify availability before claiming native coverage. Missing native cash-index intraday prices cannot be replaced with a futures conversion labelled native. YM/RTY and volatility indices/futures are contextual inputs where owned.
- Garman–Klass, Yang–Zhang, HAR-RV and IV features feed **one fitted volatility expert**, with multiple forecast heads. Do not build a separate fitted expert for each of these estimators. Different major context mechanisms and source strategies have separate fitted artifacts and diagnostics.
- Phase 2 includes method-specific day/context/setup classification, path forecasts, session suitability, branch/reference/confirmation recommendations, timing and target ambition. It is more than a global market-state classifier.
- Search breadth first using a small representative bank, then focus on evidence-supported mechanisms. Preserve opportunity frequency, missed moves and confirmation delay alongside quality. Source matching is a bounded construction check; it is not the optimization objective.
- Use owned data only. Missing inputs get precise availability dispositions; no paid acquisition proposals or external account actions are part of these packs.
- The eventual economic objective jointly optimizes profit and downside. The user's ambition is $3,000 per trading day, with less than $1,000/day unacceptable for the eventual system and a $1,000 maximum daily loss measured from day-start. Keep every eligible zero-trade day visible. A historical average cannot substitute for that daily requirement. Phase 1.5/2 component admission is not certification that this objective is achievable.

## Reading and starting

Start at the selected phase README, then use its `PROMPTS.md`. Each subphase has a generated `RUNBOOK.md` containing the applicable contracts and its task cards. The coordinator reads one runbook; a worker receives one task card plus the named contract sections. Bundles are generated from canonical files, never independently edited.

[Shared contracts](/workspace/planning/research-program/README.md) · [Execution method](/workspace/planning/research-program/WORKFLOW.md) · [Conversation scope audit](/workspace/planning/research-program/SCOPE_AUDIT.md) · [Workflow repository review](/workspace/planning/research-program/METHOD_REVIEW.md) · [Decision ledger](/workspace/planning/phase-1-live/NEXT_PHASES_DISCUSSION.md) · [Shared wiki](/workspace/wiki/index.md).

Phase 1 source definitions and archived evidence remain read-only. New code belongs to the namespaces named in the task cards. New reports get new immutable run directories. Do not patch an accepted report, source file or old scanner merely to make a comparison look better.
