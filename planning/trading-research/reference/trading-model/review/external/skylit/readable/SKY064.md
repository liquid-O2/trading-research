  title: Flowseeker — Skylit Public API
  version: 1.0.0
  summary: Real-time and historical options-flow analytics as a public HTTP API.
  description: >
    Flowseeker exposes Skylit's real-time options-flow scoring stack — Flow

    Score, FlowBonus, VWF/SDF/FIR aggregates, sector rotation, and market

    breadth — as a versioned public HTTP API. Data is sourced from the full

    OPRA options feed with sub-second freshness during market hours.


    **Authentication.** Send your Skylit API key as a bearer token:

        Authorization: Bearer fs_live_<key>

    (`X-API-Key: fs_live_<key>` is also accepted.) Your rate limit and monthly

    quota are determined by your account plan.


    **Rate limits & quotas.** Per-minute limits are enforced by the Skylit

    gateway and surfaced on every response via `X-RateLimit-Limit`,

    `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`. `429` includes

    `Retry-After`; quota exhaustion returns `403` with `code: QUOTA_EXCEEDED`.


    **Credits & billing.** Every `/v1/*` data request debits a fixed number of

    **credits** from your account's shared Skylit balance (the same balance used

    across all Skylit public APIs). Each chargeable response carries

    `X-Credits-Remaining: <balance>`. The credit is charged before the request

    is served, so a `5xx` still bills. Cost is priced by server-side work and

    data volume returned:


    | Tier | Credits | Routes |

    |------|--------:|--------|

    | Light | 1 | single-key reads, ratios, scores, discovery/search lists,
    expirations, rvol, per-contract bull/bear, the flow feed |

    | Medium | 3 | charts, full chains, by-strike matrix,
    momentum/baseline/strikes, tide, aggregate, sweeps, market, sector,
    market-breadth, chain bull/bear, unusual-volume/oi screeners, dark-pool
    top-prints |

    | Heavy | 5 | trade feeds (`/trades`, dark-pool trades), history
    (`/history`, `historical-compare`), bulk endpoints |


    `/v1/openapi.json` is free. When you run out of credits the API returns

    `402` `insufficient_credits`; a suspended account returns `403`

    `account_suspended`; a transient billing-store error returns `503`

    `credit_check_failed` (safe to retry). These billing codes are lowercase

    (`insufficient_credits`, `account_suspended`, `credit_check_failed`) — the

    platform-wide convention for credit errors.


    **Response envelope.** All success responses share one shape:

        { "data": <payload>, "meta": { "timestamp": "...", "requestId": "..." } }

    All errors share one shape:

        { "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "..." } }

    Field names are camelCase throughout. Codes are stable, machine-readable

    `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` strings — the message text may evolve.


    **Freshness.** Endpoints with a `timeframe` parameter (e.g.
    `/v1/flow/{ticker}`)

    return data through the last completed bucket. Intra-bucket fills land on
    the

    next request. The cumulative `/v1/flow/market-breadth` and aggregate scoring

    endpoints update at most once per second.
